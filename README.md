# School District Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project was to assist Maria and the school board in their analysis of 15 different high school's math
and reading grades. Unfortunately, there was evidence of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade at Thomas High School.
However, even with the exclusion of those grades there was still 38709 students data points to work with. With those 
points several important conclusions were able to be made.

## Results
With the data there was 7 results were resultants of the analysis. These, of course, were effected by the academic 
dishonesty in the 9th grade at Thomas High School. Therefore this section will seek to observe the difference between
the results with the 9th grade at THS include and the results with that grade discarded. Those comparisons are as
follows:

* How is the district summary affected?
One of the most rudimentary ways to look at the effect of the academic dishonesty is to look at the results from all of 
schools. If the dishonestly wasn't pervasive there would not be that big of a difference between the all inclusive
results and the 9th grade THS less results. Therefore, the fact that there is a .2% difference between the results
is concerning.

* How is the school summary affected?


* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the 
other schools?

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

    * Math and reading scores by grade

    * Scores by school spending
    
    * Scores by school size
    
    * Scores by school type
