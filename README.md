# School District Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project was to assist Maria and the school board in their analysis of 15 different high school's math
and reading grades. Unfortunately, there was evidence of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade at Thomas High School.
However, even with the exclusion of those grades there was still 38709 students data points to work with. With those 
points several important conclusions were able to be made.
